<p>For this first week, our team will be making a few alterations to the standard blog format for this course, mainly because we have not begun much work on our project yet. 

We have spent some time defining the project and setting up some of our goals that we would like to accomplish over the upcoming semester. The project we have decided to take on is a system that a team member has personally been working alongside their co op to accomplish on a part time basis. 

This project mainly revolves around a system that would be used to check the relative 'health' of many web and data services that currently exist in the company's infratructure. Determining if a specific service is 'healthy' will be done on an individual basis. These evaluations can range from sending simple JSON payloads to the API of a data service and checking for valid results, to making sure that notifications are properly sent out to customers in a timely manner. This system will be modular enough to be added to by any project team at the company who would like to have a simple way to verify that their data service is always functioning appropriately. The app will have several ways to display information about various applications to anyone in the company who would find the information relevant, including a system of logging, a frontend user interface that is updated every 60 seconds, and a notification system that will send emails, text messages, or pages to users who may need to verify 100% uptime of their program or service.

There will be many requirements regarding the security, responsiveness, and uptime of the application that are yet to be determined.  

In order to better understand the scope of this project and information on the high level requirements, we have decided to generate a problem and vision statement in relation to the project: </p>

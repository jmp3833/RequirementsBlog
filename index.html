<h3><a name="blog-week-5" class="anchor" href="#blog-week-5"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Blog Week 5 + 6</h3>

<p>These weeks, our team finished the first draft of our software requirements specification document (SRS). Our group took the suggested improvements on the SRS and implemented them, to create the highest quality SRS document we could. Our team also met to complete and go over our in-class presentation. 

In the upcoming weeks, our team will be working on the second increment of the SRS document, it is expected that each team member will spend several hours working on expanding the SRS document for the second increment. Our team will also spend around an hour together, to ensure that the team is on the same page and that the SRS document will be high quality. During this meeting, our group will likely go over the architecture portion of the projects, in order to not be blindsided by any work in the upcoming weeks.
We will be unable to meet with one of our stakeholders for about a week, because they are getting married.

<h3><a name="blog-week-3" class="anchor" href="#blog-week-3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Blog Week 3 + 4</h3>

<p>This week, our team worked to complete a draft of our software requirements specification document (SRS). The SRS will soon fully layout our system’s functional and non-functional requirements. In addition, to requirements the document will also include use cases to describe user interactions with the software. Justin and Bill met briefly this week to discuss what work our group needed to complete for Saturday’s submission. Colin will be working on sections 5 and 6 of the specification document. Justin and Bill will focus on updating the vision and scope template based on feedback we received last week.

As far as time commitments go for the project deliverables for the upcoming weeks, we believe that each team member will contribute an expected three hours total for our SRS submission since we have divided the work equally and would like to spend at least 1 hour meeting in person to review our document and check for validity before submission. We are also going to hold a short meeting with our sponsor to verify that the outlined requirements specifications are accurate and describe the project and its fetures thoroughly. 
Because of the fact that our team may be revising the project's SRS document quite frequently as we solidify our requirements with the stakeholder, we have allocated an additional 2 hours to each member of time outside of class to make revisions as needed. 

The team is certainly available to provide any more project information as needed over the next few weeks!

<h3><a name="blog-week-1" class="anchor" href="#blog-week-1"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Blog Week 2</h3>

<p>For this first week, our team will be making a few alterations to the standard blog format for this course, mainly because we have not begun much work on our project yet.

We have spent some time defining the project and setting up some of our goals that we would like to accomplish over the upcoming semester. The project we have decided to take on is a system that a team member has personally been working alongside their co op to accomplish on a part time basis.

This project mainly revolves around a system that would be used to check the relative 'health' of many web and data services that currently exist in the company's infratructure. Determining if a specific service is 'healthy' will be done on an individual basis. These evaluations can range from sending simple JSON payloads to the API of a data service and checking for valid results, to making sure that notifications are properly sent out to customers in a timely manner. This system will be modular enough to be added to by any project team at the company who would like to have a simple way to verify that their data service is always functioning appropriately. The app will have several ways to display information about various applications to anyone in the company who would find the information relevant, including a system of logging, a frontend user interface that is updated every 60 seconds, and a notification system that will send emails, text messages, or pages to users who may need to verify 100% uptime of their program or service.

There will be many requirements regarding the security, responsiveness, and uptime of the application that are yet to be determined.

In order to better understand the scope of this project and information on the high level requirements, we have decided to generate a problem and vision statement in relation to the project: </p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>The problem of: Many developers and quality assurance engineers getting upset when they cannot develop or test code because they are not getting appropriate results upon deployment. Most of the time it turns out that a particular service that they rely on is having errors or is down completely and they have no way of know what specific service is down.<br>

This affects quality assurance engineers, developers, managers, Team leaders, and legal/sales departments of the organization, the impact of which is inconvenience and increased development and debugging time. A successful solution would provide a clean interface that could alert QA engineers and developers when a service is down. This service could also be extended to have a web application that allows these stakeholders to check the status of all of the data services at any given time. This would drastically reduce the amount of time spent debugging new applications.<br> </p>

<h2>Vision Statement</h2>

<p> For developers and quality assurance engineers that need to be aware of specific data services that are behaving incorrectly or down all together, an application will exist that can alert users via email,sms, or pager that the service has gone or behaved not as expected. There will also be a front end user interface and extensive logging that can be checked at any time to see what specific services are down or not behaving as expected. </p>
